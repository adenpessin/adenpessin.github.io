        <h3> What is this page all about? </h3>
        <p>This website, created by me, Aden Pessin, is my CSC 106 portfolio. It will show off everything I will learn in this course,
            as everything under this domain was coded by me. I am very excited to work on this, and I can't wait to see how this website grows and evolves.</p>
